- Parse type tags
- Parse type vars

- Polymorphic types should grow:

  Currently they can be compared to a smaller type:
  > :type +(int_to_real(43), 3)
  : Real

  But until this expression is fully typed, the polymorphic should not be fully
  bound to Int and should be allowed to grow into a Real (because Real contains
  Int):
  > :type +(2, int_to_real(34))
  type error: UnificationError(IntType,RealType)
